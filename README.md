1. Team details (Names, USN)
  Md Sujan        1KS18CS047
  Manvith P       1KS18CS046
  Harshith Prasad 1KS18CS026
  
2. Contribution of each team member
  Md Sujan:-
    coding, testing, documentation
    
3. Instructions to run the program
  The Java program can be run from the command line

	steps:-
	1:Open a command promt window and go to the directory where the program is saved
	2:type: 'javac Asn03G29P11.java' then press enter to compile the program
	3:type: 'java Asn03G29P11' then press enter, the program will start running
4. Challenges faced and how did you address these
  Challenges
    Implenting the algorihtm in java
    The Union Find Algorithm was very tough to grasp
    Implementing the graph and its input by user 
    
    for almost all the problems and challenges, the sole method was googling the conceps like
    Union Find, Minimum Cost Spanning Tree, check for cycles in MCSTs, array of objects in java, Exception Handling,etc

5. What did you learn from this assignment
    Even though as of now the problem is not solved completely, there is a null pointer exception error, I understood the algorithm more thorougly than from the theory itself. 
    Another thing I learned was finding the error using the breakpoints and debugger in eclipse.
